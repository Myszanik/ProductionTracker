# AI usage

This project was built with assistance from ChatGPT.

## What I used AI for
- speeding up boilerplate Flask routes and templates
- debugging runtime errors and edge cases
- iterating on SQLite queries and validation logic
- refactoring repeated patterns into helper functions

## What I did myself
- defined the overall concept and workflow based on a real production environment
- designed station flow rules and constraints (queues, assignments, wrapping slots, lorries)
- decided the data model requirements (orders, history, settings)
- tested the app manually by simulating orders moving through stations
- integrated the full solution end-to-end (Python, HTML templates, CSS, SQLite)

## Data and privacy
- no real company data is included
- demo users and test data only
- the database file is generated locally and not stored in the repo
